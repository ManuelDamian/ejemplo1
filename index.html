        <p>I am a software engineer whose primary strengths lie in dedication and hard work. Currently, I am interested in the
        field of web development, using technologies such as JavaScript, React, and SCSS, along with Git and Jira for project
        development. I have experience in various areas of the IT industry, as well as a strong ability to work collaboratively
        in a team.</p>
